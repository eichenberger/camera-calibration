\begin{abstract}
    To reconstruct the pose and position of a camera the intrinsic camera model must once be calculated. We show a method on how to calibrate a camera based on a pregenerated point cloud. This method makes camera calibration more user friendly for augmented reality applications where pregenerated point clouds can be used.
